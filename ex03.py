#Lets start with a message always. Makes it easier to understand.
print "Counting:"

# print the value of A. Notice we can combine a string and a numerical expression.
print "A", 25 + 30 / 6

# print the value of B
print "B", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# print a compound statement. This will only show one value.
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

#print a logical comparision, notice how text and eval are written
print "Is true 3+2<5-7"
print 3+2<5-7

# Note that if we add a comma at the end of the string on first line, we can force
# printing the next print statement on the same line.

# print some more. Notice how text and code and written together
print "3+2 =", 3+2
print "5-7 =", 5-7

# print more of text and math together
print "is greater 5 > -2", 5 > -2
print "is greater or equal 5 >=-2", 5>=-2
print "is less or equal, 5<= -2", 5 <= -2
