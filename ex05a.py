print "Test thing"

my_str = 'sourav'

##  Notice that no comma was used after a formatted output, but when a second variable or string is printed then it is introduced to print on the same line.
print "we are testing %d and %d" %(my_num1,my_num2)
print "sourav age is %d" % my_num1, "and he is still young"
